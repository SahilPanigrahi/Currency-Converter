Learnings from this project:
1. HTML Structure:
   - Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document.
   - Usage of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration for specifying the HTML version.
   - Utilizing the `<head>` section for metadata like character set, viewport settings, and external resources.
   - Creating a responsive design with the use of the viewport meta tag.

2. CSS Styling:
   - Selectors and styling rules to define the visual appearance of HTML elements.
   - Flexbox for layout: Using `display: flex` to create a centered and responsive layout.
   - Styling form elements such as input, select, and button for a clean and user-friendly interface.
   - Incorporating external font-awesome icons for enhanced design.

3. JavaScript Interaction:
   - Utilizing JavaScript to dynamically populate dropdown options from a predefined list of currency codes and country codes.
   - Implementing event listeners for dropdowns to update associated flag images.
   - Fetching exchange rate data from an external API (fawazahmed0/currency-api) based on user-selected currencies.
   - Calculating and displaying the exchange rate based on user input.

4. Asynchronous JavaScript:
   - Loading external scripts asynchronously using the `async` attribute.
   - Handling asynchronous data fetching with `async/await` for a smoother user experience.

5. Version Control and External Libraries:
   - Referencing external libraries like font-awesome directly in the HTML file.
   - Using GitHub to host and access external scripts or libraries.

6. Web APIs and Data Manipulation:
   - Interacting with the FlagsAPI to dynamically load country flags based on currency codes.
   - Making API requests to get the latest exchange rates and updating the UI accordingly.

7. Responsive Design:
   - Creating a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
   - Ensuring a consistent and visually appealing layout across various devices.

From these learnings, I got a solid understanding of web development concepts, front-end technologies, and practical implementation of APIs for real-time data integration.
